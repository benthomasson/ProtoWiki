This directory contains a ProtoWiki.  Open ProtoWiki or in vim move
the cursor over ProtoWiki and type "gf" in normal mode.


ProtoWiki is a combination of Vim, Fabric, reStructured Text, and github.  Only 
Vim is required for basic operation, but if you have all the tools you
get HTML generation, source control, and simple CLI commands.
